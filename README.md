# Prediction of Cancer Metastasis in Lymph Node Whole-slide Image Patches with CNN

This is a class project for a Neural Network course in my Master degree in CS, in which I trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify histopathologic images of sentinel lymph node sections into metastatic and non-metastatic tissues. The training is done on AWS EC2.
